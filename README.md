# Three-Body-Problem

A graphical simulation of the three body problem written in C++. This project is my first C++ project, it uses the fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical method to solve an ordinary differential equation to describe the motion of three particles. The project aimed to represent this problem using fancy OpenGl graphics.
